Handle all the aspects of push notifications for your app, including remote and local notifications, interactive notifications, silent notifications, and more.

**All the native iOS notifications features are supported!**

- Remote (push) notifications
- Local notifications
- Background/Managed notifications (notifications that can be cleared from the server, like Facebook messenger and Whatsapp web)
- PushKit API (for VoIP and other background messages)
- Interactive notifications (allows you to provide additional functionality to your users outside of your application such as action buttons)

### Android

- Receiving notifications in any App state (foreground, background, "dead")
- Built-in notification drawer management
- High degree of code extensibility to allow for advanced custom layouts and any specific notifications behavior as available by [Android's API](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/build-notification.html)
- Android equivalent of React-Native's implementation of [`PushNotificationsIOS.getInitialNotification()`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pushnotificationios.html#getinitialnotification).

_Upcoming: local notifications, background-state Rx queue (iOS equivalent)_
