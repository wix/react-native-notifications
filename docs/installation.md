# Installation

As with any React Native project, the first step is to add the project as an npm dependency.

The 2nd is to do some platform specific setup so as to be able to work with Apple and Google's services for push notifications.

Start by running this:

```
$ npm install react-native-notifications@^2.0.6 --save
```

First, [Manually link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#manual-linking) the library to your Xcode project.

Then, to enable notifications support add the following line at the top of your `AppDelegate.m`

```objective-c
#import "RNNotifications.h"
```

Start monitor notifications in: `application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions`

```objective-c

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
	[RNNotifications startMonitorNotifications]; // -> Add this line

	return YES;
}

```


And add the following methods to support registration:

```objective-c

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
  [RNNotifications didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
  [RNNotifications didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
}

```

Add a reference to the library's native code in your global `settings.gradle`:

```gradle
include ':reactnativenotifications'
project(':reactnativenotifications').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-notifications/android/app')
```

Declare the library as a dependency in your **app-project's** `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
	// ...
	
	compile project(':reactnativenotifications')
}
```

Add the library to your application class (e.g. `MainApplication.java`):

```java
import com.wix.reactnativenotifications.RNNotificationsPackage;

...

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
	        // ...
	        // Add this line:
	        new RNNotificationsPackage(MainApplication.this)
        );
```

### Receiving push notifications

> Note: This section is only necessary in case you wish to be able to **receive** push notifications in your React-Native app.

Push notifications on Android are managed and dispatched using [Google's FCM service](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging). The following installation steps are a TL;DR of [Google's FCM setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client). You can follow them to get FCM integrated quickly, but we recommend that you will in the very least have a peek at the guide's overview.

#### Step #1: Subscribe to Google's FCM

To set FCM in your app, you must first create a google-services.json file. If you have no existing API project yet, the easiest way to go about in creating one is using [this step-by-step installation process](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup);


#### Step #2: Copy google-services.json

After creating google-services.json, copy it into your project's android/app folder.

#### Step #3: Add google-services package to Project/build.gradle
```gradle
buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.0'
    }
}
```

#### Step #4: Add firebase-core package and apply google-services plugin in Project/app/build.gradle
```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-core:16.0.0'
}

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

#### Step #5: RNNotifications and React Native version
<B>This step is required only for `react-native-notifications` version `2.1.0` and above.</B> <Br>

react-native-notifications supports multiple React Native versions. Target the React Native version required by your project by specifying the RNN build flavor in `android/app/build.gradle`.

```diff
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.yourproject"
        minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion
        targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion
+        missingDimensionStrategy "RNNotifications.reactNativeVersion", "reactNative60" // See note below!
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

!>Important note about `missingDimensionStrategy`<Br>
>`reactNative59` - RN 0.59.x and below<Br>
>`reactNative60` - RN 0.60.0 and above

Now we need to instruct gradle how to build that flavor. To do so here two solutions:

#### 5.1 Build app with gradle command

**prefered solution** The RNNotification flavor you would like to build is specified in `app/build.gradle`. Therefore in order to compile only that flavor, instead of building your entire project using `./gradlew assembleDebug`, you should instruct gradle to build the app module: `./gradlew app:assembleDebug`. The easiest way is to add a package.json command to build and install your debug Android APK .

```
"scripts": {
  ...
  "android": "cd ./android && ./gradlew app:assembleDebug && ./gradlew installDebug"
}
```

Now run `npm run android` to build your application

#### 5.2 Ignore other RNN flavors

If you don't want to run `npm run android` and want to keep the default `react-native run-android` command, you need to specify to graddle to ignore the other flavors RNNotifications provides.

To do so edit `android/build.gradle` and add:

```diff
+subprojects { subproject ->
+    afterEvaluate {
+        if ((subproject.plugins.hasPlugin('android') || subproject.plugins.hasPlugin('android-library'))) {
+            android {
+                variantFilter { variant ->
+                    def names = variant.flavors*.name
+                    if (names.contains("reactNative59")) {
+                        setIgnore(true)
+                    }
+                }
+            }
+        }
+    }
+}
```

**Note**: As more build variants come available in the future, you will need to adjust the list (`names.contains("reactNative59")`). This is why we recommend the first solution.
